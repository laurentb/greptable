greptable
=========

Description
-----------

``greptable`` generates a plain-text list of your servers, databases and tables,
so that you can easily find where the fuck that table is, with your favorite
search tools, like ``grep``.

This is especially useful if you are dealing with many servers and databases.

Requirements
------------

``greptable`` works on both Python 2 and Python 3.

The only dependency is ``SQLAlchemy``, and it should support the same databases.
