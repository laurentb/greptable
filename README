greptable
=========


Description
-----------

``greptable`` generates a plain-text list of your servers, databases and tables,
so that you can easily find where the fuck that table is, with your favorite
search tools, like ``grep``.

This is especially useful if you are dealing with many servers and databases.


Requirements
------------

``greptable`` works on both Python 2 and Python 3.

The only dependency is ``SQLAlchemy``, and it should support the same databases.


Usage
-----

For global options run ``greptable -h``.

Listing tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To list the tables, run ``greptable dump``.

You can change the configuration file path with the ``-c``
(also known as ``--config``).
By default, it uses ``~/.config/greptable.conf`` if it exists,
otherwise ``greptable.conf`` from the current directory.

The tables are listed to the standard output by default.
The ``-o`` (also known as ``--output``) option can dump in a file instead.

Example: ``greptable -c greptable.conf dump -o tables.txt``

For full help on options run ``greptable dump -h``.


Configuration
-------------

The configuration is a standard INI file.
Section headers are `SQLAlchemy URLs <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html>`_.

For example::

    [mysql://user:password@server1]
    [sqlite:///db.sqlite]

``greptable`` will try to prettify server URLs, but you can also force a name.

For example::

    [mysql://user:password@server1]
    [sqlite:///db.sqlite]
    name = db
